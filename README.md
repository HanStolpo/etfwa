Overview
===================
This is the code that accompanies a talk I gave at my
local functional programming users group about [exploring
typed functional web applications](http://hanstolpo.github.io/TalksAndStuff/slides/2015-11-23-Exploring_Typed_Functional_Web_Applications_Part_1.html#/exploring-typed-functional-web-applications-part-1).

There is a little Haskell server written in servant for the server side and the client side
is PureScript using purescript-halogen and building using WebPack.
